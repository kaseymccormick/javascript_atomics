    <h1>Output with alert and log writeup</h1>

    <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
    <p>alert activates a pop up that the user can see with the information the developer puts between the parenthesees. Console.log puts the information in the console area only accessable via inspecting element.</p>

    <h2>What's one situation where you might use an alert() to tell the user something?</h2>
    <p>redirecting to another website or explination of doing something beyond norm</p>

    <h2>What's one way that alert() might get obnoxious?</h2>
    <p>to many of them at the same time or an aleart appearing while you're trying to type something in. an alert with ambigious wording</p>

    <h2>Would it make sense to use console.log() to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>
    <p>no, the average user won't know how to collect that information.</p>

    <h2>What's one way that console.log() might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
    <p>to record when a step has been acheived, to help debug or step through what the program is doing.</p>

    <h2>When do the console.log() statements get run? Is it before the first alert() gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?</h2>
    <p>console commands are executed after the pop up appears click okay on the alert. Checked via inspect element and reloading the page.</p>

    <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
    <p>none at the moment</p>
