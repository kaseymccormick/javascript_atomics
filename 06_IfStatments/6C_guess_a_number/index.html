 <h3>If you collect the user's input as a string (i.e. without using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), does == work to compare the input to the stored secret number? Would === work? Which is best?</h3>
 <p></p>
  <h3>If you collect the user's input as an integer (i.e. by using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), can you use == to compare? ===? Which is better in this case?</h3>
  <p></p>
  <h3>What is the difference between == and ===?</h3>
 <p>The strict equality operator === only considers values equal that have the same type.
The lenient equality operator == tries to convert values of different types, before comparing like strict equality.</br>

  <h3>In this case, does it make more sense to leave the user's guess as a string, or to convert it to an integer? Why? What are the relative advantages / disadvantages of each approach (particularly in terms of the types of new features that might be able to be added)? </h3>
