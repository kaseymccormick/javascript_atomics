  <h2> Does it matter what order your if / else if statements happen? If you reorder them, does your program still produce correct output?</h2>
  <p>doesn't seem to effect it</p>
  <h2> What's wrong with this conditional: if (age < 16 && age > 21)?</h2>
  <p>if age is greater than 16 and age is greater then 21 is redundant, if the age is above 21 then it's going to be above 16.</p>
  <h2> Let's say that your program needs to be easy to modify so that it works in parts of the country/world where the age ranges are different. How would you replace the numbers in your if statements with variables to make the program make sense? Or is it easier to just have the numbers be there? Does it matter?</h2>
  <p>use variables that are easy to understand and set at the begining such as drinkingAge</p>
