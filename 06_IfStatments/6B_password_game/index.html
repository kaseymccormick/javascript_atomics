 <h3>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h3>
 <p>it needs to have the correct spacing and capitalization.</p>
 <h3>Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h3>
 <p>i used === because everything i've read so far says use === unless you have a good reason not to. Also seems it's the only predictable comparison.</p>
<h3> Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h3>
<p>It can easily be accessed by simply inspecting element. Also likely could be overwritten easily</p>
