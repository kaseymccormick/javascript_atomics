    <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as NaN?</h2>
     <h3>Prediction: <span>all of the tests fail and returns sadness gap.</span><h3>
          <p>Why: i have it parse to intiger before tests go through runing a test of math logic will fail when there's not an intiger.</p>

  <div class="exersize">
    <h2>What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is 0? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?</h2>
     <h3>Prediction: <span>it will fail being a triangle but some side checks could pass.</span><h3>
          <p>Why: one of the lengths is zero it would likely fail as it's hard to get 0 plus a number to be higher then the third. A triangle with 0 length is an angle. er line?</p>

  <div class="exersize">
    <h2>What happens if the user inputs one or more negative integers for the lengths of the triangle's legs?</h2>
     <h3>Prediction: a side can pass but a full triangle won't<h3>   
          <p>Why: I haven't done all caculations but a combination of negative plus positive numbers to create the needed 3 passing sides seem very thin. Technically a length shouldn't be negative so it should just fail, but that's not in the logic yet.</p>
