  <h2>The math can be accessed via console</h2>
  <h3>What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like "Error 404"? How about "404 Error"? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?</h3>
  <p></p>
  <h3>What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?</h3>
  <p>It takes the input but the operations fail, throw NaN error in console</p>
  <h3>Why might you use the increment (++) or decrement (--) operators? What are some applications that you predict might come into play?</h3>
  <p>to tally an item such as score or quanitity</p>
  <h3>What questions do you have?</h3>
  <p>Look up how to increment until ... found something need to test to work</p>
