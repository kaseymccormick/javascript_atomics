  <h2> Given what you know so far, what are some reasons to use variables?</h2>
  <p>to pass information from one step to another, to create a framework that updates with content via variable</p>
  <h2> What are some advantages to variable names like hairColor instead of hc (for example)? What are some disadvantages?</h2>
  <p>more discriptive, easier to read when trying to figure out what the code snippet does. Is longer to type and have to remember exact capitalization/spelling</p>
  <h2>  Given what you know so far, what can you predict about other ways we might use variables?</h2>
  <p>to determine what step to take next if variable equals 'something' do this if its 'something else' do that</p>
  <h2> Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do?</h2>
  <p>it initalizes the variable 'sets it'</p>
  <h2> What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h2>
  <p> if variable is not set the response is undefined. no error messages in console</p>
  <h2> What questions do you have?</h2>
