Ask the user (using prompt()) for their name, then assign that value to a well-named variable.
Ask the user (using prompt()) for their age, then assign that value to a well-named variable.
Ask the user (using prompt()) for their hometown, then assign that value to a well-named variable.
Ask the user (using prompt()) for their favorite number, then assign that value to a well-named variable.
Output each of those values using both console.log() and alert(). You can output the value itself with no context around it, but it's a better decision to use each of those values in a sentence. For example: "Your name is Aloysius."
