//inclination was to use an array and see if the user's input was in the array. Hello tougher. Had to look at an example//
//set variable to intiger version of the user's input radix 10//
  var userNumber = parseInt(prompt("I need a number between 1 and 8"), 10);
  //loop while the user number input is greaterthan or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 8//
    while (userNumber >= 1 && userNumber <= 8) {
      //set variable to intiger version of the user's input radix 10//
      userNumber = parseInt(prompt("I need a number between 1 and 8"), 10);
